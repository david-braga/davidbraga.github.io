        <p>
            When creating a website we bascially use HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Langauge, CSS, short for
            Cascade Style Sheet,
            and Javascript or JS.
        </p>

        <p>
        <div class="sub-topics">HTML</div>
        HTML is the structure of a Web page, it labels the pieces of content the browser displays. In other words,
        it's the text.

        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="sub-topics">CSS</div>
        CSS is the style or the look of the page and with it you can control how the html elements will look in the
        broswer.

        </p>
        <p>
        <div class="sub-topics">JS</div>
        Javascript is what allows the interaction between the user and the web page in a dynamic way.
        </p>

        <p>

        <div class="sub-topics">ID and CLASS: what are they and which one to use?</div>

        <p>
            ID and Class are selectors that can be added to html elements so they can be acessed using CSS and/or JS.

        </p>

        <p>
            The value to identify an ID must be used once only in the whole project.

        </p>

        <p>
            You can have as many IDs as you want but its value must be unique to one specific element only.

        </p>


        <p>
            Here is an example of how to add an ID to an element in HTML:
            <img src="../img/id in html.png " alt="ID in html">
        </p>
        <p>
            And here how to link the element in CSS:
            <img src="../img/id in css.png" alt="ID in css">
            note that you need to use "#" (hash symbol)
        </p>

        <p>

            Class on the other hand can be used for elements that share the same attributes,
            which means the same value can be used more than once.

        </p>
        <p>
            But for classes both CSS and JS can use the value to acess the element.

        </p>
        <p>
            How we use JS to access the element via class will be shown later.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is how to add a class to an element on HTML:
            <img src="../img/class in html.png" alt="class in html">
        </p>

        <p>
            and how to link it in CSS:
            <img src="../img/class in css.png" alt="class in css">
            note that you have to use "." (dot)
        </p>
