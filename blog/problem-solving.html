            PROBLEM SOLVING
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and all other programming languages necessary to run a code, learning
            how to deal and solve a problem is another major skill web developers must have.
        </p>

        <p>
            Almost on a daily basis that's what we'll be doing, solving problems. And so you don't go crazy, the first
            thing to do is accept the idea and learn how to deal with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working in a project, whether it's a website, an app or anything else, it's just a bunch of problems
            that are connected and if you break them down into small pieces will help to solve them and

            get them all together at the end. As everything else, practice is key and there are different techniques and
            processes you can use:
        </p>

        <h3>
            Pseudocode
        </h3>
        <p>
            Preplan and write in plain english the steps to be taken to write the code. Adding or changing the order as
            you plan
            them is part of the process and it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Trying something
        </h3>
        <p>
            Give it a go on a idea that comes to mind and see if it works.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Rubber Duck method
        </h3>
        <p>
            Explain to a rubber duck in details line by line the code your trying to wirte. It's possible you'll find
            out what's
            missing or where you're doing the mistake by listening to yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Read Error Messages
        </h3>
        <p>
            Read the error message displayed and if it's clear enough give a solution to the problem from wha the
            message describes.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Console.logging
        </h3>
        <p>
            Use DevTools and test result using console.log to see if your code works.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Google
        </h3>
        <p>
            Search for the problem and its solution on Google.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Asking you peers or coaches for help
        </h3>
        <p>
            Ask someone that does the same you doing or your facilitator can be really helpful. They probably went
            through the same and asking them for help can be a fast way of solving the problem.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reflection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Always after finding a solution to a problem take time to reflect on it. It'll make it easier to
            you avoid doing the same mistake in future.
        </p>
