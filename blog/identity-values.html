            After self-reflecting a lot, speaking to family members and friends I can say I'm a reserved
            person, who values the family, friendship, integrity and perseverence.

            There's one particular situation that really marked me.
        </p>

        <p> When I started working as a receptionist in a Backpacker in Queenstown, life was awesome because I was
            always
            meeting different people from all over the world, doing bungee jumps, skydiving, white water rafting, etc,
            all
            for
            free, besides living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

            I wasn't making enough money, though, to do anything else other than pay rent and food. One day, on the way
            back
            home after work, I decided to take the "scenic route" and instead of walking on the street I took the track
            that
            goes along Lake Wakatipu. It was almost night time and I didn't see
            anyone else all the way. When I was getting close home I found a wallet on the ground with a lot of money on
            it
            (enough to hold me on for a couple of months). I took the wallet and won't lie I thought about keeping it
            without
            saying anything, but I didn't.
            By the time I got home all I could think of was how the person who had lost it was feeling and what that
            money
            could
            be for so I walked all the way back to town and handed in the wallet at the police station. Walking back
            home
            again,
            all I could feel and think of was peace of mind.
        </p>

            I considere myself a perseverant person so when I want something I give everything to get it,
            doesn't
            matter how hard it is. I would say that's the main strength I've got to keep on going during this course
            even
            though I can easily get distracted when reading or studying,
