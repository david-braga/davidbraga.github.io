            After self-reflecting a lot, speaking to family members and a friend I can say I'm a reserved person, who
            loves
            the
            family, perseverant when desires something and grateful for all I have.

            <p> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the
                values
                involved
                in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>

        <p> When I started working as a receptionist in a Backpacker in Queenstown, life was awesome because I was
            always
            meeting different people from all over the world, doing bungee jumps, skydiving, white water rafting, etc,
            all
            for
            free, besides living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p>
        <p>
            I wasn't making enough money, though, to do anything else other than pay rent and food. One day, on the way
            back
            home after work, I decided to take the "scenic route" and instead of walking on the street I took the track
            that
            goes along Lake Wakatipu. It was almost night time and I didn't see
            anyone else all the way. When I was getting close home I found a wallet on the ground with a lot of money on
            it
            (enough to hold me on for a couple of months). I took the wallet and won't lie I thought about keeping it
            without
            saying anything, but I didn't.
            By the time I got home all I could think of was how the person who had lost it was feeling and what that
            money
            could
            be for so I walked all the way back to town and handed in the wallet at the police station. Walking back
            home
            again,
            all I could feel and think of was peace of mind.

            <p> Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
                Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
                Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect

            I considere myself a perseverant person so when I (really) want something I give everything to get it,
            doesn't
            matter how hard it is. I would say that's the main strength I've got to keep on going during this course and
            even
            though I can easily get distracted when reading or studying, the will to change will

            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was
            resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were,
            and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
