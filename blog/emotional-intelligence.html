            *How is it different to IQ?
        </p>
        <p>
            While IQ can be measured by a score comparison with other individuals that have taken the IQ test and are in
            the same age group's result, EQ is more related to emotion-based problem solving.

        <p>

            * Why is it important?
        </p>
        <p>
            Measuring the IQ is not the only way to find out if someone will succeed in life as it was believed in the
            past. Nowadays more companies use EQ tests as part of their
            hiring process, since researches found that good leaders had higher emotional intelligence.
