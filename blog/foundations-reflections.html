            *What have you learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
        </p>

        <p>
            That I don't have to be ashamed asking for help when I don't understand something or be embarrassed of my
            work. Also that I don't have to compare my work with others' as we all have different backgrounds.
        </p>



        <p>
            *What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
        </p>

        <p>
            It's part of the process of learning and programming to work with others not only when seeking for help but
            also when providing it so we all must be humble and empathetic.
        </p>

        <p>
            * What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning about neuroplasticity and growth mindset.
        </p>

        <p>
            *What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </p>

        <p>
            Reflecting and writing about my values and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            *Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a
            web development bootcamp course?
        </p>

        <p>
            Because it's very important to learn and develop these skills to be part of the tech industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            *Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not at all, reflecting and understanding myself better, learning how to deal with problems and how to work
            with others was something I''ll take it for life.
        </p>
