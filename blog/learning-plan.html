            *What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </p>

        <p>
            After succesfully concluding the Bootcamp and becoming a Junior Full Stack Developer I want to start working
            for
            a
            company straight away so I can keep improving my technical and interpersonal skills.

            Long term goal is to become a Software application developer and work for a big tech company.
        </p>

        <p>
            *A description of your own strenghts and limitations in relation to learning:
        </p>

        <p>
            If a reflect enough about something and decide that's what I want to do I'm good at following the necessary
            steps to
            do so and achieve it. Good examples are the idea of
            coming to NZ and also doing this Bootcamp.

            The problem though is that I get drisctrated easily when reading and also catch myself trying to understand
            too
            much
            of sometthing and end loosing the main focus.
            I also need to improve my time management skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
            Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
            I need to improve my communication skills so I can enhance my networking skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            *A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
        </p>

        <p>
            a)An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
            facilitators
            and industry/community representatives:
        </p>
        <p>
            Being determined to become a web developer will give me the discipline needed to work hard everyday. And
            Improving
            time management by tracking my time
            will allow me to work in a productive and consistent way not only for me but also with others.
        </p>

        <p>

            b)What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
        </p>

        <p>
            To keep my mind fresh I have the necessity of practicing a sport, either a walk/run, swim or going to the
            gym so
            I'll keep that as part of my plan on a weekly basis.
            Once I see I'm struggling with something I will take a break to refresh my mind before getting back to the
            "problem". And in case I don't figure it out, I'll ask for help
            in the group channel or to facilitator.
        </p>

        <p>
            *A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to succeed and for that I will need to follow the deadlines, so if I'm stuck I will ask my colleagues
            and/or
            my facilitator for help either in the group channels or privatly.
        </p>

        <p>

            *A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:
        </p>

        <p>
            Give me feedbacks, positive or negative, as I move through the course, and help me with any issues,
            technical or
            non-technical, I may face.
        </p>

        <p>
            *Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
            might
            have whānau commitments like school drop-offs.
            It’s important to plan these in.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm pretty much 100% focused on doing the Bootcamp but as I mentioned previously, to keep my mind going I
            need
            to do
            somekind of exercise so I've going for a walk/run and
            doing workout exercises at home on a daily basis, either before or after I "start"or "finish" the day and I
            plan
            to
            keep on doing that all the day through the course. I understand that
            during the 9-week Bootcamp things can get a bit "crazy" but I'm still determined to stay fresh minded. Other
            than
            that, just helping with the basic house duties (shopping, cooking, cleaning)
            whenever needed.

        <p>
            *What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </p>
        <p>


            That is actually a good question, relooking at my learning plan and thinking about the future I'm not sure
            exactly what my goal is but what I know now is that I want to develop a great career in the tech industry
            maybe owning my own
            business and relating Tehcnology with (either) Tourism and (or) Sports.
        </p>
        <p>
            * What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </p>
        <p>
            My willingness to learn and all the support I'm getting from my wife and parents are my biggest stregnths.
            My
            limitations might be overthinking on everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            * What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </p>
        <p>
            Creativity for my portoflio.

        </p>
        <p>
            * What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev
            Academy?
        </p>
        <p>
            Better time management and leadership skills.
        </p>

        <p>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </p>
        <p>
            To guide me through the process showing the best way to understand each topic and how to put them together.
        </p>
        <p>
            *What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to truly feel confident about my knowledge and make it to the end with a good portoflio so I can jump
            straight into the job market so I can learn more and so on..
