            HTML and CSS as an analogy:

        <p> To create a simple website all you need is <span>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</span> and <span>CSS
                (Cascading Style Sheets)</span>.
            Think of them as an engineer and an architect. The HTML(engineer) is reponsible for the structure of the
            building while the architect (CSS) makes what you see from the outside look good, addding style to it. They
            both use their own knowledge (rules) but in order to get the building (website) done they need to work
            together.

            Control Flow and Loops:

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
            <span>Control flow</span> is basically the order the computer reads and/or executes (runs) the code.
            It's meant to run from the top of the page to bottom, but it's quite common to find on the way something
            (conditions or loops) that can change that order.Loop is the sequence of steps or instructions done until a
            specified condition is met. We can use "eating" as an example. First we grab the food with a fork/spoon.
            Then we take the food into the mouth. Chew the food. Swallow it. We repeat (loop) this until we're full.

        <p> DOM and examples of how we interect with it:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
            DOM is short for Document Object Model and in simple words, is the way we use JavaScript to manipulate a
            webpage. We can add or change a text of a webpage without using the html file. We also manipulate CSS
            styles. We do that by selecting an element and storing a reference to it inside a variable then
            using properties and methods, for example: element = document.querySelector(selectors) that returns
            the first element in the document that matches the specified selector.

            Accessing data from Arrays and Objects:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
            Both arrays and obejcts are used to store nummerous values. The main difference to access these from an
            Array or an Object is that in an array we use the index(or the number) in which the value is stored.
            And with objects we use the name of the property that we want to access.

        Functions and why they are useful.
    </div>

    <div class="blog-content">
        <p>
            Functions are like commands we give the computer to perform. We need to provide one or more parameter(s) and
            one or more statemen(s) inside it, then we need to call using its name where in the scope you want it
            executed. They are useful to store pieces of code that can be easily reused with a short command instead of
            having to type the code again, or multiple times.
