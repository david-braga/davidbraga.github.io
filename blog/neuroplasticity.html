            Neuroplasticity is the ability our brain has to change or adapt and even reshape through our experiences,
            thoughts and practice. People should learn about and understand how important it can be not only
            for personal growth, like learning a new language or how to play an instrument, but also to get out of
            depression, for example.

            In my case, as I'm learning a whole lot of new skills on my journey to become a web developer, the more I'm
            aware that's how the brain works the more I will learn. I need to practice basically everyday
            so I'm constantly accessing my memory and strengthening the neural connections with my brain.

            There's a video on Youtube I found very interesting and that explains in a very simple way what
            Neuroplasticity is and how it works. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g"

            to watch it.

        <p> Growth mindset is to believe you can develop attributes, habits or learn new skills with practice, hard work
            and positivity. It's important for people to learn about it so they don't doubt themselves when
            trying to change something in their lives or trying to do something new or that seems hard.

            My experience while learnig to code is I catch myself sometimes in panic thinking how am I gonna learn all
            this in a short period of time. That's when I take a break and start reflecting and understand that
            it's not impossible, it just demands me to stay focused, positive and practice practice and practice not
            letting myself doubt it.
